# Tobi's Quiz

A simple browser-based quiz builder written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
You can create your own questions, mark which answers are correct, and then play through the quiz to test yourself.

## How it works

1. Open `quiz_maker.html` in your browser.
2. Enter a question and up to four answers in the form.
3. Tick the checkbox next to the correct answers.
4. Click **Add Question** to store it.
5. Repeat steps 2â€“4 to add as many questions as you like.
6. When ready, click **Start Quiz** to begin.

During the quiz:
- Questions are asked one at a time.
- You can select one or more answers.
- After submitting, correct answers turn **green**, and wrong selections turn **red**.
- The quiz automatically moves to the next question.
- At the end, you see your total score.

## Features

- Add multiple custom questions.
- Mark one or more answers as correct.
- Immediate feedback (color-coded answers).
- Automatic progression through the quiz.
- Final score shown at the end.

## Future Plans

Eventually the quiz maker should become usable in a classroom setting. Future updates will include a host and player mode
where the host submits questions and the players their answers. At the end the players will receive their scores.
